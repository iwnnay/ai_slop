Here is the children's story based on your idea:

**The Great Garden Gift**

In Mrs. Green Thumb's beautiful garden, Luna, a curious and kind 6-year-old rabbit, loved to spend her days planting and tending to the vibrant flowers. Her best friend, Benny, a playful and gentle 7-year-old bear, loved exploring the garden with her.

One sunny day, Benny asked Luna if she wanted to play hide-and-seek among the colorful blooms. Luna agreed, and they set off on an adventure. As they played, Benny got more and more excited, not noticing where he was going. Suddenly, he tripped and accidentally knocked over Luna's favorite flower bed!

Luna gasped in shock as her beautiful flowers tumbled to the ground. She felt like she had spent hours planting and nurturing those flowers, only for them to be ruined in an instant. Benny looked at Luna with a worried expression, realizing what he had done.

"Oh no, Luna! I'm so sorry!" Benny exclaimed, his voice trembling. "I didn't mean to hurt your flowers!"

Luna's eyes welled up with tears as she gazed at the destroyed flower bed. She felt sad and disappointed that her hard work had been undone. Benny tried to comfort her by giving her a big hug.

**The Problem:**
Luna was devastated about the state of her flower bed, feeling like her efforts were wasted. The garden, once full of beauty and life, now seemed dull and destroyed.

**The Resolution:**
Benny and Luna decided to work together to fix the flower bed and make it even more beautiful than before. Mrs. Green Thumb, noticing their distress, offered guidance and encouragement. Together, they planted new flowers, added some sparkly decorations, and created a special "apology bouquet" for Luna.

As they worked side by side, Benny used his strength to dig and plant the new flowers, while Luna used her gentle touch to water and nurture them. They chatted about their favorite colors and what kind of flowers they liked best. The garden began to bloom once more, filling the air with sweet scents and lively buzzing from the bees.

**The Moral Lesson:**
As they finished up their project, Luna smiled, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. Benny grinned, relieved that he had made things right. Mrs. Green Thumb praised them for their teamwork and perseverance.

"You both showed that even when we make mistakes, we can apologize and work together to fix things," she said. "And sometimes, turning something negative into something positive is the greatest gift of all!"

**The Great Garden Gift:**
As a symbol of their apology and newfound understanding, Benny and Luna presented Mrs. Green Thumb with their special bouquet. The flowers were arranged in a beautiful basket, adorned with colorful ribbons and a sweet note that read: "We're sorry for what happened to your garden, but we worked together to make it even more lovely! - Luna and Benny"

The story concludes with the three friends standing together, admiring their handiwork. The garden was once again filled with life, beauty, and friendship.
