## Lila and the Mood Monster: The Day the Monster Turned Blue

Lila’s kitchen was a sunny, happy place. Sunbeams danced on the big, soft rug, and the air smelled like warm cookies. Lila, with her bright, bouncy hair (a little messy, just like she liked it!), was playing with her very best friend. His name was the Mood Monster.

The Mood Monster was soft and fluffy, like a cloud. He had big, gentle eyes and a round tummy. And he had a *special* magic: **his fur changed color!** When Lila was happy, playing a game or eating a cookie, the Mood Monster’s fur glowed **bright, sunny yellow**. It was the happiest color! Lila loved hugging her yellow Monster.

But lately, Lila had been playing with the Mood Monster *all by herself*. She didn’t want to share him. When her little brother Ben, with his wobbly legs, asked, "Can I hold the Monster, Lila?" Lila shook her head. "No! It’s *my* Monster!" She held the Monster close, like a secret.

Then Maya, Lila’s best friend, came over. Maya had a big, colorful picture. "Look, Lila! I drew a sun for the Monster!" Maya said, holding up her drawing. Lila just said, "No! I’m playing *with* it! Go play with your blocks." She clutched the Monster tighter. The Monster felt very, very lonely.

Lila didn’t see it, but the Mood Monster’s fur, which had been so bright yellow, started to change. It got **darker... and darker... and finally, deep, deep blue.** The Monster was *very* sad. He missed being hugged by Ben and seeing Maya’s drawings. Sharing made the Monster happy! But Lila didn’t know that.

Later, Lila sat on her favorite chair in the "Mood Monster Corner" (a special spot with the softest rug). She looked down at her Monster. **His fur was deep, deep blue.** "Huh?" Lila whispered. "Why are you blue, Monster? You’re *my* best friend!" She tried to make him happy. She hugged him. She sang a song. She even offered him a cookie. But the Monster stayed **blue.**

Lila felt a little worry in her tummy. "What’s wrong, Monster?" she asked, her voice small. She remembered her mom saying, "Sharing makes friends happy, Lila." *Happ*? The Monster was *blue*... not happy. *Sharing*? But Lila didn’t *want* to share. She liked having the Monster all to herself.

Then Lila looked around. Ben was sitting by the window, holding a tiny red car, looking very quiet. Maya was drawing on the floor, her face serious. Lila saw that Ben and Maya looked a little... lonely too. Just like the blue Monster.

**Lila had an idea!** Her heart felt warm, like sunshine. "Ben!" she called, her voice bright. "Here! You can hold the Monster for a bit!" She carefully handed the blue Mood Monster to Ben.

Ben’s eyes got big! "Wow!" he said. He hugged the Monster tight. And *flicker... flicker...* The deep blue fur on the Monster’s tummy started to **glow a tiny, tiny bit yellow!** Ben beamed. "He’s happy, Lila! He’s happy!"

Lila smiled. "Maya! Would you like to show the Monster your picture?" Maya’s eyes lit up like a firefly. She carefully held her sun drawing up to the Monster. "Look, Monster! The sun is warm and happy, just like you should be!" As Maya showed the Monster the bright yellow sun, the Monster’s fur **glowed BRIGHT, SUNNY YELLOW!** It was the happiest yellow ever!

"Yay!" Lila, Ben, and Maya all laughed. Lila sat on the rug, Ben sat next to her, and Maya showed the Monster her picture again. The Monster was hugged, and he watched the sun drawing. He felt *so* happy. Lila, Ben, and Maya played together – Ben made the Monster "drive" the car, Maya showed him more pictures, and Lila helped them all. The Mood Monster’s fur stayed a warm, happy yellow.

Lila looked at her friends, then at her blue-and-now-yellow Monster. She felt happy. *Really* happy. "Sharing makes everyone smile!" Lila said, and she was right. The Monster was happy. Ben was happy. Maya was happy. And Lila? Lila was the *happiest* of all. She knew, now, that her very best friend, the Mood Monster, loved to share. And sharing with friends? It was the *best* game of all. The sun shone through the window, and the Mood Monster’s yellow fur glowed as bright as the sun. **Sharing makes everyone smile!** 😊
