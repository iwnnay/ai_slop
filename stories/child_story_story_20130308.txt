Here is a children's story based on the idea:

**Luna's Little Light: A Tale of Friendship and Sharing**

In a sunny meadow filled with colorful flowers, buzzing bees, and soft grass, lived a curious and gentle rabbit named Luna. She loved to learn and share with her friends.

One day, while exploring the meadow, Luna discovered a beautiful, glowing stone that she decided to keep as her own special treasure. The stone seemed to glow brighter when she held it, and she felt happy knowing it was hers alone.

Meanwhile, Leo, a playful and mischievous fox, loved to collect shiny objects. When he found out about the glowing stone, he became jealous and wanted it for himself. "Why should Luna get to keep all the fun?" he thought.

A disagreement ensued, and the friends decided not to play together until one of them gave in. The sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the meadow.

As the light faded, Luna realized that sharing the stone with Leo would bring more joy than keeping it all to herself. She decided to give the stone to Leo, explaining that having a friend like him was even more precious than any treasure.

Leo was thrilled and apologized for being jealous. "I'm sorry I didn't ask you first," he said. Luna forgave her friend and smiled, knowing that sharing was the best way to show how much she cared.

The two friends hugged, and the glowing stone began to shine brighter than ever before. Its light spread throughout the meadow, symbolizing the power of friendship and sharing.

From that day on, Luna and Leo played together every day, sharing their toys and treasures with each other. The glowing stone became a reminder of the joy that comes from sharing and being kind to one another.

**Rhyming Refrain:**

When friends are kind and share with glee,
Their hearts fill up with happiness, you'll see.
Sharing brings us closer every day,
And makes our friendships grow in a special way!
