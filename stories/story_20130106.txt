## Zig and the Soggy Puddle

**Zig** loved building. Big, tall, wobbly, *perfect* things! Today, the rain had made the backyard **soggy**, **shiny**, and **wet**. The air smelled like cool, damp earth. And in the middle of the yard, there was a **Puddle**. A big, wobbly, *shiny* Puddle, like a pool of liquid silver! It made a happy little sound: **"Drip-drip-drip!"**

"Ooh!" said Zig. "A *perfect* mud castle! Right here!" Zig grabbed a bucket and a spoon. "Mud! Mud! MUD!" Zig dug and dug. The mud was **slimy** and **sticky**, like a wiggly snake! Zig patted it. It *squelched*. Zig patted it *harder*. It *squelched* and *fell apart*.

"Ugh!" said Zig, stomping a foot. **"SQUISH!"** The mud flew. "I’m not a *happy* builder! I’m not a *good* builder! I’m a *soggy* builder! Ugh! *SQUISH!*" Zig threw the spoon into the Puddle with a **"PLOP!"**

The Puddle wobbled. It **giggled** a tiny, happy sound: **"Drip-drip-drip!"**

"I’m not a *boring* puddle!" it said, in a voice like raindrops on a leaf. "I’m a *shiny* puddle! A *silly* puddle! A *CASTLE* puddle!"

Zig looked. The Puddle was **wobbly**. It was **shiny**. And... *Zig’s eyes went wide*... the Puddle looked like a **crown**! A big, wobbly, silver crown!

**Zig got a great idea!**

Zig ran to the edge of the Puddle. They gathered **mud** (not *too* wet, just *just right*). They piled it around the Puddle, making a **big, muddy wall**. They found **twigs** for tall, pointy **towers**. They found a **big, green leaf** and stuck it on top of one tower – a **flag**!

Then, Zig did the best thing of all. Zig **plopped** right down *in* the Puddle. **"SPLASH!"** The water was cool and wobbly. Zig sat on the shiny silver crown.

"**I am the King of the Puddle Castle!**" said Zig, with a big, happy smile. "And you," Zig pointed at the Puddle, "are my **shiny, silly, castle Puddle!**"

The Puddle wobbled. **"Drip-drip-drip!"** It was the best giggle ever.

Zig and Puddle sat together on the cool, wobbly throne. The rain pattered on the leaves. The mud castle was perfect. The Puddle was the king. And Zig? Zig was the **happiest** builder of all.

**When things get messy, try *seeing* them in a new way—and the 'problem' might turn into the *best* thing yet!**

*What’s the next 'soggy thing' in your yard? A muddy boot? A wet leaf? Go build a *new* castle with it! Plop! Splash! Drip-drip-drip!* 🌧️👑💦
