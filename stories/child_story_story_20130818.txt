Here is the children's story based on your idea:

**Luna's Little Lights**

In a magical forest filled with tall trees, sparkling streams, and colorful flowers, there lived a curious and adventurous young rabbit named Luna. She loved to explore every nook and cranny of the forest, making friends with all the animals who lived there.

One of Luna's best friends was Benny, a brave and clever squirrel who loved to help her on her adventures. Together, they discovered hidden clearings, chased after butterflies, and played hide-and-seek behind the trees.

Luna had another favorite thing to do: collecting shiny objects she found in the forest. She kept them all in her cozy little burrow, where she would admire their sparkle and shine. Her collection was her pride and joy!

One day, a strong wind blew through the forest, scattering Luna's treasures far and wide! She was devastated when she saw what had happened. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she gazed out at the empty space where her treasures used to be.

Benny noticed that Luna was upset and asked what was wrong. When he heard about the lost treasures, he offered to help her get them back. "We can do it!" he exclaimed. "We just need a plan!"

Luna's eyes lit up with hope as she thought about all the possibilities. Together, they decided to meet with their friends in the forest and ask for their help.

The first friend they met was Professor Hootenanny, a wise old owl who loved to teach and learn. When Luna explained her problem, he listened carefully and then said, "Ah ha! I think I know just what we need to get your treasures back."

"What is it?" Luna asked eagerly.

"We need something called 'little lights'," the Professor explained. "These special lights can help us find and collect the scattered treasures. But we'll need to create them ourselves!"

Benny's eyes grew wide with excitement as he listened to the plan. "We can do it!" he repeated, determined to help his friend.

Luna and Benny spent the next few days collecting different types of rocks and minerals from around the forest. They learned about the unique properties of each one and how they could be combined to create the special little lights.

Finally, the day arrived when they were ready to test their new invention. With Professor Hootenanny's guidance, they assembled the device and shone it out into the forest.

To their amazement, the light began to glow brightly, illuminating a small patch of ground where one of Luna's treasures lay hidden! They cheered and hugged each other, knowing that this was just the beginning.

With the little lights leading the way, Luna and Benny were able to retrieve all of her lost treasures. When they finally returned to her burrow, it was overflowing with sparkle and shine once again!

Luna beamed with joy as she thanked her friends for their help. "I couldn't have done it without you," she said, hugging Benny tightly.

Benny smiled, happy that he could make his friend's day a little brighter. As they sat together amidst the treasures, Luna realized something important: that sometimes it takes teamwork and perseverance to solve problems, but with friends by your side, anything is possible!
