**The Little Cloud Who Wanted to Shine**

In the bright blue sky, there lived a small, fluffy cloud named Luna. She loved playing hide-and-seek among the wispy clouds, but deep down, she felt sad. You see, no one could ever see her shining face because she was always hidden behind bigger, bolder clouds.

Luna longed to be like those big, puffy clouds that seemed so proud and radiant. She wanted everyone in the sky to see her and admire her beauty. But whenever she tried to puff up to match their size, she ended up looking lumpy and awkward!

One sunny day, as Luna was drifting lazily across the sky, she met a friendly sunbeam named Sammie. Sammie loved making friends with clouds and always had a warm, cheerful smile.

"Hello there, little cloud!" Sammie beamed. "What's wrong? You look like you've lost your sparkle!"

Luna sniffled. "I just wish I could be seen by everyone in the sky. I'm so small and hidden behind bigger clouds."

Sammie chuckled. "Ah, Luna, being small is not what makes a cloud special! Everyone has their own way of shining. It's not about being the biggest or brightest; it's about being true to yourself!"

Luna looked puzzled. "Really?"

Sammie nodded. "Yes! Even I, as just a sunbeam, bring warmth and light to the clouds and the world below. Your unique shape might be small, but it can create adorable cloud shapes that bring joy to others!"

Inspired by Sammie's words, Luna decided to take a chance and shine in her own way. She started to puff up with air, not trying to get bigger or brighter like before, but instead creating tiny, puffy cloud shapes that looked like animals, objects, and even food!

As she floated along the sky, her creations brought smiles to the faces of other clouds and even a few curious birds flying by. They chirped and tweeted in delight at Luna's whimsical cloud art.

Sammie beamed with pride. "See, Luna? Your smallness is exactly what makes your shapes so special! You're making others happy just by being yourself!"

Luna's face lit up with happiness. She realized that Sammie was right; she didn't need to be big or bold to shine. Her tiny cloud shapes were a unique way for her to share her creativity and bring joy to the world.

From that day on, Luna became known as the Cloud Artist of the Sky! She continued to create adorable cloud shapes, inspiring other clouds to do the same. And whenever she needed guidance or encouragement, Sammie was always there to remind her that being true to oneself is what truly makes us shine!
