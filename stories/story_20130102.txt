## Pip the Mouse and the Wobbly Dandelion

Pip the mouse was the tiniest mouse in the sun-dappled meadow. His soft, gray coat felt like a cloud, and his tail wiggled *wiggly-wiggly-wiggle* when he was excited. Today, he was *very* excited! The giant dandelions (as tall as Pip himself!) were blowing their fluffy seeds into the air. Pip had a very important job: finding the *biggest, fluffiest* dandelion seed for his cozy nest. A dandelion pillow! Perfect for sleeping.

He scurried through the buttercups, their yellow faces like tiny, happy suns. He hopped over the soft, mossy log. He listened to the tiny stream *gloop-gloop, gloop-gloop* as it chuckled over the pebbles. The breeze hummed a lullaby, just for him. *Squeak!* "I *must* find the best seed!" Pip said, his little nose twitching.

Then, he saw it! The *biggest* dandelion seed in the whole meadow! It was as big as Pip’s whole body, soft and white as a cloud. "Yes! My perfect pillow!" he squeaked. Pip carefully, *very* carefully, used both tiny paws to lift it. But the seed was **WOBBLING!** It wobbled like a wobbly cup of tea. Pip held it tighter. "Steady now," he whispered. But the seed **TUMBLING!** It tumbled like a tiny, bouncy ball. Pip tried again. "Almost there!" he said. But the seed **SQUISHING!** It squished right out of his paws! *Plop!* It rolled away.

Pip puffed out his chest. "I *must* do it alone!" he declared. He ran after the seed, his tail wiggling with determination. He picked it up again. **WOBBLING!** **TUMBLING!** **SQUISHING!** *Plop!* It tumbled right out of his paws. He tried again. And again. And again. Each time, **WOBBLING! TUMBLING! SQUISHING!** *Plop! Plop! Plop!* The seed rolled farther and farther away. Pip felt his tiny heart sink. "I can't do it," he mumbled, his tail drooping. The seed was too big, too heavy, too *wobbly* for one mouse. He sat on the mossy log, his nose almost touching the ground. The stream *gloop-glooped* on, and the breeze hummed a sad little tune.

Just then, a bright splash of red fluttered down. Bella the robin landed on the log beside Pip. Her red wings were like a tiny, happy flag, and she had a cheerful "Chirp!" for everyone. "Pip! Need a helper?" she chirped gently.

Pip shook his head, his ears drooping. "No, Bella. I *must* do it alone!" he said, his voice small. "It's my pillow!"

But the seed wasn't listening. It rolled *toward* the stream! The water was *gloop-glooping* right towards a big, muddy puddle! The seed would get wet and soggy, and then it would be *no good* for a pillow! Pip's eyes got wide. "Oh no!" he squeaked. "The seed is going to the puddle!"

Bella's beady eyes sparkled. "Pip, let's help the seed *together*!" she chirped. "You hold it steady, and I'll blow it *towards* you!"

Pip looked at the wobbly seed, then at Bella's bright red wings. The seed was *bigger* than him, and the stream was *gloop-glooping* fast. Maybe... just maybe... asking for help *was* okay. He took a deep breath. "Okay, Bella," he said. "Let's help the seed!"

Bella flapped her wings *gently*, *gently* just like a soft breeze. "Blow, blow, blow!" she chirped. A soft puff of air pushed the wobbly seed *towards* Pip.

Pip held out both tiny paws. "Here it comes!" he squeaked. The seed **WOBBLING!**... but Pip held it steady! **TUMBLING!**... but Pip held it tight! **SQUISHING!**... but Pip held it *just right*! The seed was safe in Pip's paws.

"Good job, Pip!" chirped Bella. "Now, let's tuck it into your cozy nest!"

Pip and Bella scurried back to Pip's tiny burrow under the mossy log. Pip carefully placed the big, fluffy seed right into his nest. It was the *most* perfect, softest, fluffiest pillow in the whole meadow! Pip snuggled down. His tail wiggled *wiggly-wiggly-wiggle* with the biggest, happiest smile.

"Thank you, Bella," he whispered. "This is the BEST pillow... *and* it's a Bigger-Than-Me-Seed-Adventure!"

Bella flapped her bright red wings. "You're welcome, Pip! And you know what? Some things *are* bigger than us. That's why friends are here to help!" She gave a final, happy "Chirp!" and flew off to find her own special something.

Pip snuggled into his dandelion pillow, the soft fluff surrounding him. The stream *gloop-glooped* gently, the breeze hummed a lullaby, and Pip closed his eyes. He was warm, safe, and very, very happy. He'd found the best pillow... *and* the best friend. And he knew, deep in his little mouse heart, that sometimes, the biggest adventures are the ones you share. *Sshhh...* Pip was fast asleep, dreaming of giant, wobbly, fluffy seeds.
