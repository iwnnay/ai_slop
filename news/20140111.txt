1. **Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Disappearance**: On January 11, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.

2. **Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's Death Sentence**: On January 11, 2014, an Egyptian court sentenced former President Mohamed Morsi to death for his role in the murder of protesters during his presidency.

His legacy had a profound impact on international relations, politics, and social justice movements worldwide.
4. **North Korea's Nuclear Test**: On January 11, 2014, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test in three years, sparking widespread condemnation from the international community. The test was seen as a major provocation by the regime of Kim Jong-un and heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

These events demonstrate the significance of January 11th, 2014, which saw the disappearance of a commercial airliner, a landmark political decision in Egypt, the passing of a global icon, and a provocative act of nuclear testing from North Korea.
